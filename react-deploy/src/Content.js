            Iâ€™ve always been asked: why computer science and psychology?
            <br />
            <br />
            I'm interested in cognitive science, which is an interdisciplinary
            field that integrates knowledge in computer science, psychology,
            linguistics, philosophy, etc. I'm curious about human language and
            the mechanisms for cognitive processes, as well as how to simulate
            human responses using machine learning techniques. I believe having
            a strong background in both computer science and psychology can give
            me a deeper insight into cognitive science.
            <br />
            <br />
            Additionally, I had a lot of fun making my ideas into actual
            applications - from online office hours platform to menstrual health
            game and more. As an aspiring full-stack developer, currently I've
            been focusing on iOS and web apps. I mostly work with
            UIKit/SwiftUI/ReactJS for frontend and Firebase/Firestore/SQL for
            backend. I'm looking forward to learning more about software
            development and creating more impactful projects!
